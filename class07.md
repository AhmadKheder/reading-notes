# Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## Model epic fails videos 

Imagine you've been tasked to build a program that models the popularity of epic fail videos. After months of painstaking research, you've determined that the two essential metrics for gauging popularity are an epic rating and whether or not the video has animals.

Since you'll be modeling the popularity of many types of videos—parkour epic fails, corgi epic fails, etc.—you'll want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors. That way, when you need to change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes will be small and targeted.



As you read this article, type out and run all code samples you come across. Do not copy and paste. Writing out and testing your code will help you remember how to implement domain models in JavaScript later.

## CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX 
 an empty object
called hote 1 is created using the
constructor function.
Once it has been created, three
properties and a method are
then assigned to the object.
(If the object already had any
of these properties, this would
overwrite the values in those
properties.)
To access a property of this
object, you can use dot notation,
just as you can with any object. 
```javascript


var hotel = new Object();
hotel.name= 'Park';
hotel.rooms = 120;
hotel .booked = 77;
hotel .checkAvailability = function()
return this.rooms - this.booked;
} ;
JAVASCRIPT
var elName = document.getElementByid('hotelName');
elName.textContent = hotel . name;
var elRooms = document .getElementByid('rooms');
elRooms.textContent = hotel .checkAvailability(}; 
```

## ADDING AND REMOVING PROPERTIES 

```javascript
var hotel = {
name : 'Park' ,
rooms : 120,
booked : 77.
} ;
hotel .gym = t rue;
hotel .pool = fal se;
delete hotel .booked;
var elName = document .getEl ementByld('hotelName ');
elName.textContent = hotel . name;
var el Pool = document .getElementByid ('pool ') ;
elPool.cl assName = ' Pool: ' + hotel. pool ;
var elGym = document .getEl ementByld('gym' };
elGym.className = 'Gym: ' + hotel .gym; 
```
